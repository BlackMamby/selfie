							<h2>How the internet<br/>
							<span>is CHANGING us</span></h2>
							<p>
								The advent of social networks changed drastically the way in which we define our identity. These social platforms are the actualization of the "global village," a term coined by the media and communication theorist Marshall McLuhan in 1964 to describe the phenomenon of "the world's culture shrinking and expanding at the same time due to pervasive technological advances that allow for instantaneous sharing of culture." (V.K. Dixon) These modern day global villages called Facebook, Instagram, etc. leaded us to establish a brand new approach of presenting ourselves to others, mainly through the use of images rather than words. The most common way of doing it is through self-portraits taken with phone cameras called "selfies." Even though they are apparently similar to the old-school self-portraits, selfies are created for another purpose: search for approval and opinions. The sense of judgment speaks through the "like" expressed by friends and users on major social: criticism, smiley faces, and extra exclamation points are a boost of self-esteem able to straighten insecurity, fear, and need for approval. Selfies are replacing the ability to communicate through words creating a world made out of photos of perfect bodies, unbelievably ideal couples, and  fake smiles. But, are those persons really that happy and perfect? According to psychological studies and research, it seems that hidden behind the camera lie desperation, discouragement, and unhappiness. The camera-click button is only the initiator of this self-annihilation process that find his peak when the photo is published on the socials. It's there that the number of likes, flatteries, winking hashtags, or squalid ethical comments do the dirty job: they make the real person behind the camera, and behind the monitor slowly disappear. It's the raise of a brand new faked person. It's an individual that live his/her life, unconsciously, to give it to the others. It's  person who sold his soul to the devil, hoping to get in exchange happiness and approval. The result? A painful lost of identity.
